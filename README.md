Caffe-Android-Lib
===============
## Goal
Porting [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) to android platform

### Support
* Up-to-date caffe ([d91572d](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/commit/d91572da2ea5e63c9eaacaf013dfbcbc0ada5f67))
* CPU only
* Without support for some IO libs (leveldb and hdf5)

## Build
Tested with Android NDK r11c and cmake 3.3.2 on Ubuntu 14.04

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tognos/caffe-android-lib.git
cd caffe-android-lib
export ANDROID_ABI="arm64-v8a" # Optional, see the note below
./build.sh <path/to/ndk>
```

### NOTE: OpenBLAS
OpenBLAS is the only supported BLAS choice now, and the supported ABIs are the following:

* `armeabi`
* `armeabi-v7a-hard-softfp with NEON`
* `arm64-v8a` (default)
* `x86`
* `x86_64`

## Issues

Any comments, issues or PRs are welcomed.
Thanks.

## TODO
- [ ] integrate using CMake's ExternalProject
- [ ] add IO dependency support (i.e., leveldb and hdf5)
- [ ] OpenCL support
- [ ] CUDA suuport

## Optional
`.envrc` files are for [direnv](http://direnv.net/)
> direnv is an environment variable manager for your shell. It knows how to hook into bash, zsh and fish shell to load or unload environment variables depending on your current directory. This allows to have project-specific environment variables and not clutter the "~/.profile" file.
